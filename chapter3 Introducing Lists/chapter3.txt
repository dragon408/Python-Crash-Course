A list is a collection of items in a particular order.

list name = ['something0', 'something1', ..., 'somethingN']

!!!Index Positions Start at 0, Not 1!!!

You can also use the string methods from Chapter 2 on any element in a list

By asking for the item at index -1, Python always returns the last item in the list

Most lists you create will be dynamic, meaning you’ll build a list and
then add and remove elements from it as your program runs its course.


Changing, Adding, and Removing Elements
Changing: 
    ur_list[index_of_elem_that_u_change] = 'new_meaning'
Adding(to the end of list):
    ur_list.append(new_item)
Adding a new element at any position in your list:
    ur_list.insert(index, new_item)
Removing by index:
    del ur_list[index]
Removing an Item Using the pop() Method:
    The pop() method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work
    with that item after removing it.(This method showed in chapter3.py)
Popping Items from any Position in a List:
    Same but u can remove any element, just write .pop(index)
Removing an Item by Value:
    list_name.remove()


Organizing a List
.sort() -  method makes it easy to sort a list
You can also sort this list in reverse alphabetical order by passing the
argument reverse=True to the sort() method.
.sorted() - function lets you display your list
in a particular order but doesn’t affect the actual order of the list
.reverse() - to reverse the original order of a list
len() - Finding the Length of a List
